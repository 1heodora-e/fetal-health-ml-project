## Project Overview
This project presents a systematic comparison of traditional machine learning and deep learning models for the automated classification of fetal health from Cardiotocography (CTG) scans. The goal is to develop an objective, data-driven decision-support tool to assist clinicians. The work is based on a series of 12 structured experiments designed to evaluate different algorithms and apply targeted optimization techniques to solve real-world data challenges like class imbalance and overfitting.

## Problem Statement
The interpretation of CTG signals is a highly skilled task that suffers from significant subjectivity, which can lead to critical clinical errors such as missing signs of genuine fetal distress (false negatives) or performing unnecessary surgical interventions (false positives). This project addresses this challenge by developing a reliable and objective classification model.

## Dataset
The project uses the "Fetal Health Classification" dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Fetal+Health+Classification). It contains 2,126 instances with 21 numerical features extracted from CTG scans by expert obstetricians. A key challenge identified in the data was a significant
